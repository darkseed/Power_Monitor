Power_Monitor
=============

Arduino and Processing sketches for Power Monitor Shield

View the Design_Report.pdf document for the write up of the project done by Christopher McNally.

>The sample code was written for use with 3000 Turn [CR Magnetics] split core transformer. (http://www.crmagnetics.com/Products/CR3100-Series-P75.aspx)

>If using the current transformer from seeedstudio http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Noninvasive-AC-Current-Sensor-100A-max-p-547.html?cPath=25_28 then the code needs to be changed as this is a 2000 turn transformer.
